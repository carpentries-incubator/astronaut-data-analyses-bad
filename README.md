## Not so good astronout data analysis code

This repository contains a helper software project with some code to be used 
for the [FAIR research software course](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-research-software). 

This repository is an example of "not so good" software that is meant to be improved over the course to show examples of better 
and more FAIR software practices. 

### Things to improve
There is a number of things that are wrong or not so good with this code and that can be improved. We maintain that list at issue
https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/astronout-data-analyses-bad/issues/2.

### Better code
An example of better and more FAIR code that participants should strive to achieve when writing their reseach software 
can be found at [astronout-data-analyses-fair repository](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/astronout-data-analyses-fair), 
to be used on conjuction with this repository during the course.
