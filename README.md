## Not so good astronout data analysis code

Helper software project with code examples for the [FAIR research software course](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-research-software). 

It contains some "not so good" code that is meant to be improved over the course to show examples of better software practices. 
An example of better and more FAIR code that participants should strive to achieve when writing their reseach software 
can be found at [astronout-data-analyses-fair repository](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/astronout-data-analyses-fair).

### Things to improve
There is a number of things that are wrong or not so good with this code, that can be improved, for example:
